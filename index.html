            <p>
                Hi, I’m Gaby Dalkin, and this is my food blog. I love cooking. I love eating even more. It seems that wherever I go recipes jump out at me and this blog is my place to record them. They are usually quick and simple, mostly seasonal and always delicious. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family and I do.

            <p>Oats are loaded with fiber, so they’re a great healthy breakfast! If you’re like me, though, you might run the risk of getting stuck in an oat rut.</p>
